#summary Embedding sceye-fi in your application

= Embedding sceye-fi in your application =

First, you need to load a configuration file with one of the load() static methods in class org.tastefuljava.sceyefi.conf.EyeFiConf:

{{{
    public static EyeFiConf load() throws IOException;
    public static EyeFiConf load(File file) throws IOException;
    public static EyeFiConf load(URL url) throws IOException;
}}}

The one that takes no parameter will try to find a Settings.xml file either in *user.home*/Application Data/Eye-Fi/ or *user.home*/Library/Eye-Fi/.

An Eye-Fi server is started by invoking the start method of class org.tastefuljava.sceyefi.server.EyeFiServer. The method returns an instance of the EyeFiServer class. To shut it down, call the close() method:

{{{
    EyeFiServer server = EyeFiServer.start(conf, new DiskFileHandler());
    try {
        // ... a lot of useful stuff
    } finally {
        server.close();
    }
}}}
